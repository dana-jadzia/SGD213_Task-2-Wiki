### Description
<!-- THIS CAN BE DELETED AT THE END [//]: # (This is the elevator pitch, sell the idea)
Players play as humanoid donuts trained in the art of ninjitsu. 
Players cooperate in teams of 2 to overcome the other teams in an arena-style, top-down, dagger-throwing, action-brawler. 
After gaining victory, the winning team is given the opportunity to unlock epic loot by facing the Dragon... -->

Players play as the last remaining survivor on a foreign alien spaceship with only 2 guns and grenades.\
When trying to escape the spaceship, players will encounter wandering enemies that will look at the player when in range.\
This is just the start of an amazing FPS game.

### Begin Date

## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

### Requirements
[//]: # (What are the requirements of the finished project?)
* Needs the product in 5 weeks.
* Gameplay should be fast-paced   << ??
* Rounds should be short   <<  ??
* Should be quick to restart
* Feedback is a major point
* People should be drawn to the game by its appearance and design
    * Needs a catchy name

### Expectations
[//]: # (What are the client's expectations?)
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Communication with the client when design issues are encountered
* Quality transparent project management (add the client)
* Does **not** require audio
* Does **not** require high quality art
    * Can use basic geometry
    * Should still look nice using colour palettes

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Particles will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, we will use standard assets or free particle assets
