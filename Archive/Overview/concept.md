## Brief
The client is looking for a first-person shooter template to be developed for use in classes. The product is requested to have:
- Basic enemy AI that walks around and can detect the player when in range.
- Player movement.
- 2 interchangeable guns for the player.
- Grenade for the player.
- The game is to be similar to Doom, Halo 1-2, Quake, or Duke Nukem-style.
