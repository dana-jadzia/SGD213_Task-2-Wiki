# Project Risks 

## Risk Identification
- The project is corrupted, or branches cannot be pushed, resulting in a rollback and potential loss of work.
- Working with a group may cause miscommunication issues.
- Code may be filled with bugs and errors due to the short work time.
- Essential code may be incomplete due to misunderstandings of importance.
- The client is unclear about their desired outcomes of the project.
- Team members are unable to complete their work due to unforeseen circumstances.

## Risk Management
- Create approval requirements in source control to stop unapproved merge requests. Using source control to roll back if changes cause corruption to the work.
- Regular communication between team members to ensure everyone is clear on the project tasks and goals.
- Consistent testing of code throughout production to minimise potential issues.
- Regular communication between team members to ensure clarity on the project outcomes, along with a Trello board to track tasks and progress.
- Task priority list to ensure the most essential aspects are delivered.
